# WD4

TODO:
- Change account reset modal confirmation button to text-danger (need to ensure it is only effective on this one modal)
- Display order history
- Show message on trade limit set
- Limit price pending orders
    - Auto execution of pending limit orders
    - Display pending limit orders so they can be modified/cancelled
- Make sure mobile view UI/UX is working well
- Deal with commented out code for settings
- Need to update data on order confirmation modal at time intervals or have the trade time out
- finish setting up global variables
- Expand number of tokens/coins tradable
- Set own initial cash balance on account reset in user preferences - default to 100k

Ideas to consider in general
- Watch list - click reloads chart with intended pair
- Implement trade fees - add validation to take fees into account
- Create function to format currency presentation
- Implement stop loss (market)

Ideas to consider in second iteration of site (condensed mostly to one page)
